Then on any web browser go to the url: localhost:8000/main.html

Notes:

For the command line version use main.py instead of gui.py

All code for the front end is written in HTML, CSS, and JS.
Source code for the front end can be found in the /web directory.

All backend code is written in python 3.6
Driver code is written in C.  The source code can be found in the /driver directory.

Code was tested in Linux Mint 19 which runs kernel version 4.15.x

This program uses eel [https://github.com/samuelhwilliams/Eel].
